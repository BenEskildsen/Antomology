 - panning
    - don't render items not on screen
 - zooming
    - zoom relative to the center of the screen
    - screen size in grid cells should be on the state, not the config
    - configure min and max zoom
 - add background layer
 - add gravity
 - big entities:
    - simpler collision function based on grid lookup
    - fix lookupInGrid uses that should just be collidesWith
    - support rotated big-entities
    - picking up big entities
    - subdividing bigger entities on pickup
    - collision detection when bigger entities move around
 - add other entities: beetles, worms, spiders, aphids
 - make food size scale by calorie amount with better thresholds
 - food that ants can coordinate to lift


 - - - - - - ANTS - - - - - -
 - compute old-age death for ants
 - make location position in center instead of top left for moving towards
 - A*-like for ants moving towards location?


 - - - - - - TASK EDITOR - - - - - -
 - behaviors should support lists of child behaviors
 - explicitly return to parent behavior as a setting in the SWITCH_TASK behavior
 - option for deleting behaviors in Task Editor
 - conditionals with OR/AND


 - - - - - - LEVELS - - - - - -
 - tasks etc. should be initialized in all levels
 - init systems should be inside level creation
 - specific level with some story component


 - - - - - - UI / UX - - - - - -
 - Add a bunch of tasks to default tasks
 - left-click-and-drag seems overloaded with functionality
 - add pause functionality/button
 - change cursor based on userMode
 - Call out ants near death of old age
 - saving with local storage


 - - - - - - PHEROMONE TRAILS - - - - - -
 - tool for clearing pheromone
 - behavior setting to follow trail backwards
 - support categories of pheromone you can select and have different colors
 - allow ants to lay trail fowards/backwards


 - - - - - - RENDERING - - - - - -
 - better anti-aliasing for dirt
 - use sprites for entities
 - animations, marquees, etc. should be rendered >10fps


 - - - - - - ACCESSIBILITY - - - - - -
 - test on firefox
   - fix dropdowns
   - fix selection weirdness
 - make UI elements screen-size responsive


 - - - - - REFACTOR - - - - -
 - essentially need a "stack" for nested behavior execution or else e.g. a
   do-while inside a conditional while also only do the do-while as long as
   the outer condition is true. Also child tasks should be treated as part of
   this behavior stack
 - fix flow errors
 - MOVE action implementation sucks
 - get optional chaining working
 - state/tasks is disorganized
 - switch dead ants/larva to their own entity type


 - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - -
 - picked-up pupa never hatch and then die on putdown. Should probably just wait to hatch

 - - - - - - SATURDAY - - - - - - -
 - sending an ant through a location causes it to switch tasks to that location
 - ants sometimes don't fall when at clicked position
 - idling ants should move a bit too


 - - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - - -
 - picked-up pupa never hatch and then die on putdown. Should just wait to hatch
 - ants might rotate a pheromone trail instead of stack on it
 - off-by-one on big entity pick up might say one more than are holding


 - - - - - - - - MENUS - - - - - - - - -
 - add game over system
 - on level win, pop modal to say you won
 - go to next level from modal
 - go back to main menu when you win the last level


 - - - - - - PHEROMONE TRAILS - - - - - -
 - support categories of pheromone you can select and have different colors
 - add UI/support for conditionals on pheromone categories


 - - - - - - WORLD - - - - - -
 - FoW performance -- try to avoid background sky tiles


 - - - - - - LOCATIONS - - - - - -
 - tool for deleting locations
 - default task for locations should be some sort of idling


 - - - - - - UI / UX - - - - - -
 - add display names for dropdown options, rename highlevel action to DO
 - add pause functionality/button
 - change cursor based on userMode
 - saving with local storage
 - audio system
 - show egg-laying cooldown for queen
 - Sidebar cards placed over top of the game window
 - UI that fills the window
 - blip the clicked grid square when sending ants somewhere
 - hotkeys:
    - get meta key set up
    - let cmd/ctrl + left click == right click
    - get space set up
    - init keyboard should be made to work at state level instead of game level
    - set up button and number field to register their onkeydowns
 - zooming:
    - configure min and max zoom
    - screen size in grid cells should be on the state, not the config
    - zoom to mouse instead of center of screen


 - - - - - - TASK EDITOR - - - - - -
 - behaviors should support lists of child behaviors
 - option for deleting behaviors in Task Editor
 - cleaner UI around all behaviors


 - - - - - - LEVELS - - - - - -
 - fix up level 1
 - new harder level 2
 - clean up tasks inside levels
 - clean up levels on main menu


 - - - - - - LIFTNG BIG ENTITIES - - - - - -
 - picking up:
    - ants should put down when they are re-assigned/go away
    - dead ants shouldn't count towards held
 - moving:
    - ants need to be able to push held entity up against gravity
    - how to compute ants falling off
 - putting down:
    - ants should get out of the way and let it fall
 - how to carry something up


 - - - - - - RENDERING - - - - - -
 - better anti-aliasing for dirt/everything
 - use sprites for entities
 - animations, marquees, etc. should be rendered >10fps


 - - - - - - PERFORMANCE - - - - - -
 - another round of profiling
 - FoW computation is very bad for performance
    - can use a 'vision' entity
 - track down memory leaks


 - - - - - ALPHA STRETCH GOALS - - - - - -
 - add other entities: beetles, worms, spiders, aphids
 - food search random walk
 - big entities:
    - support rotated big-entities
    - subdividing bigger entities on pickup
    - falling big entities should push down and/or crush solitary ants
 - fog of war:
    - support partial rendering of big entities that are partially visible
 - groups of ants can ignore gravity by climbing on each other
 - panning with mouse on the side of the screen
 - conditionals with OR/AND
 - better pathing for ants that involves random walk when they get stuck


 - - - - - - ACCESSIBILITY - - - - - -
 - test on firefox
   - fix dropdowns
   - fix selection weirdness
   - firefox uses ev.code == 'Enter' instead of keyCode
 - make UI elements screen-size responsive


 - - - - - - LEVEL EDITOR - - - - - -
 - still can add pheromone trails
 - still can pan
 - palette for drawing out each entity type on mouse move
    - allow specifying dimensions of obelisk
    - mousedown creates entity, mouse move drags it, mouseup drops it in place
 - ability to set world size
    - move viewport and fix zoom on making world smaller
 - action for making many entities at once faster
 - exporting levels
    - make level exports compressed somehow


 - - - - - REFACTOR - - - - -
 - essentially need a "stack" for nested behavior execution or else e.g. a
   do-while inside a conditional while also only do the do-while as long as
   the outer condition is true. Also child tasks should be treated as part of
   this behavior stack
 - fix flow errors
 - MOVE action implementation sucks
 - get optional chaining working
 - switch dead ants/larva to their own entity type, centralize ants dying fn
 - antBlockingEntities should be renamed to moveBlockingEntities
 - passing around location names instead of ids is V dangerous
 - common function for ant switching tasks
 - condition for whether to render marquee is ridiculously overcomplicated
 - init systems should be inside level creation

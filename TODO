 - system for applying level actions on load
 - MOVE high level task appears to do nothing
 - elseBehaviors don't seem to work (at least with pickup dirt)
 - level editor queue needs to record setting the world size
 - ants trying to find pheromone trail won't reverse in a 1x1 outer edge
 - ants dead of old age keep health bar showing -- turn off old age death
 - putdown food on a larva should just feed it
 - new harder level 2
 - clean up levels on main menu
 - fix how level data gets applied so it's not so janky


 - - - - - - THINK ABOUT - - - - - -
 - pheromone trail organization
 - FoW again...
 - Level 2


 - - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - - -
 - off-by-one on big entity pick up might say one more than are holding
 - dragonfly passes through dirt
 - can see dirt disappear in the fog
 - when many ants kill a worm they get stuck on the food
 - render target on top of everything
 - ants carrying obelisk don't move out of the way properly any more
 - ants can't move the obelisk they are carrying


 - - - - - - PHEROMONE TRAILS - - - - - -
 - pheromone categories
    - conditions on pheromone UI
    - check condition before following trail
    - only follow trail with same category of trail you've been following
    - don't delete pheromones of different strength


 - - - - - - - FOG OF WAR - - - - - - -
 - track ant vision radii in the grid as entities (no overlaps!)


 - - - - - - WORLD - - - - - -
 - queen should probably heal over time


 - - - - - - LOCATIONS - - - - - -


 - - - - - - UI / UX - - - - - -
 - make canvas truly full screen and fully responsive
 - blip the clicked grid square when sending ants somewhere
 - hungry ants look bad
 - add instructions to options menu
 - styling
    - button css
    - cleaner UI around all behaviors
 - cursor
    - change cursor based on userMode
 - ticker
    - what to say on levels 1 and 2
 - zooming:
    - configure min and max zoom
    - screen size in grid cells should be on the state, not the config
    - zoom to mouse instead of center of screen


 - - - - - - TASK EDITOR - - - - - -
 - option for deleting behaviors in Task Editor


 - - - - - - LEVELS - - - - - -


 - - - - - - LIFTNG BIG ENTITIES - - - - - -
 - picking up:
    - ants should put down when they are re-assigned/go away
    - dead ants shouldn't count towards held
 - moving:
    - ants need to be able to push held entity up against gravity
    - how to compute ants falling off
 - putting down:
    - ants should get out of the way and let it fall
 - how toA carry something up


 - - - - - - - - MENUS - - - - - - - - -


 - - - - - ALPHA STRETCH GOALS - - - - - -
 - food search random walk
 - big entities:
    - support rotated big-entities
    - subdividing bigger entities on pickup
    - falling big entities should push down and/or crush solitary ants
 - fog of war:
    - support partial rendering of big entities that are partially visible
 - groups of ants can ignore gravity by climbing on each other
    - perhaps have "stable" as a property that is computed once at the start
      and then when the entity moves
 - panning with mouse on the side of the screen
 - conditionals with OR/AND
 - better pathing for ants that involves random walk when they get stuck
 - audio system
 - saving with local storage
 - hotkeys:
    - get meta key set up
    - let cmd/ctrl + left click == right click
    - set up button and number field to register their onkeydowns
 - have dead selected ants say how they died
 - add pheromone trails in level editor
 - bring back reinforcing pheromone trails
 - let hovercards still display on pause


 - - - - - - LEVEL EDITOR - - - - - -
 - deal with editor UI being exceedingly wide
 - level editor palette for drawing out each entity type on mouse move
    - allow specifying dimensions of obelisk
    - mousedown creates entity, mouse move drags it, mouseup drops it in place
 - add undo/redo to level editor
 - tool for creating worms/other segmented entities
 - assign tasks to locations in level editor


 - - - - - - RENDERING - - - - - -
 - better anti-aliasing for dirt/everything
 - use sprites for entities
 - animations, marquees, etc. should be rendered >10fps


 - - - - - - PERFORMANCE - - - - - -
 - another round of profiling
    - 250 x 250 w/ 1000 ants seems to be about the limit
    - 200 x 200 is last smooth size
    - world size affects game far more than ants
 - track down memory leaks


 - - - - - - ACCESSIBILITY - - - - - -
 - test on firefox
   - fix dropdowns
   - fix selection weirdness
   - firefox uses ev.code == 'Enter' instead of keyCode
 - make UI elements screen-size responsive


 - - - - - REFACTOR - - - - -
 - essentially need a "stack" for nested behavior execution or else e.g. a
   do-while inside a conditional while also only do the do-while as long as
   the outer condition is true. Also child tasks should be treated as part of
   this behavior stack
 - behaviors should support lists of child behaviors
    - Add Behavior button in Conditional behavior and else behavior fields
    - conditional behavior and else should be arrays of behaviors
 - fix flow errors
 - get optional chaining working
 - passing around location names instead of ids is V dangerous
 - condition for whether to render marquee is ridiculously overcomplicated
 - init systems should be inside level creation
 - init keyboard should be made to work at state level instead of game level
 - level editor is not resilient to updating properties of entities
 - subtract calories at doAction site, not ant level
 - move hovercards under UI

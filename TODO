 - - - - - - TODO - - - - - -
 - make pickup/feed/eat more intuitive
 - On create task, switch dropdown to editing that one
 - button for exporting tasks as json
 - button for importing task jsons
 - Make larva, eggs, pupa, selectable
 - egg,larva, pupa UI cards
 - prioritize feeding larva

 - - - - - - NEXT - - - - - -
 - switch dead ants/larva to their own entity type
 - RANDOM move behavior for staying inside a location
 - ant calories should only go down when they do something
 - compute old-age death for ants
 - Call out ants near death of old age

 - - - - -  LATER - - - - - -
 - A*-like for ants moving towards location
 - implement pan/zoom with grid-to-canvas size conversion
 - add background layer
 - support canvas resize
 - implement the rest of the conditions
 - implement the rest of the actions
 - conditionals with OR/AND
 - mark should be its own entity instead of applying just to dirt

 - - - - - REFACTOR - - - - -
 - essentially need a "stack" for nested behavior execution or else e.g. a
   do-while inside a conditional while also only do the do-while as long as
   the outer condition is true
 - tasks need a "parent" task or else switching tasks within a repeating task won't repeat
 - get flow working
 - as long as we're treating locations/tasks uniquely by name, store only those names
 - cached entityID arrays in state should be the same as the entityType
 - better init for systems
 - split gameReducer into entityReducer, antReducer, gameReducer, and mouseReducer
 - state --> game where applicable
 - using collides selector for everything makes optimization harder...
    - in tickReducer/performAction for moves being possible
    - in tickReducer/evaluateCondition for if ant is at a location
    - in tickReducer/performAction for pickup/putdown being possible
    - in keyboardControlSystem/onmousedown for what was left clicked on
    - in keyboardControlSystem/onmousedown for what was right clicked on
    - in selectors/getFreeNeighborPositions
    - in foodSpawnSystem
 - get optional chaining working
 - after fixing Go To Clicked Location bug, can store locations as strings on behaviors


 - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - -
 - ants can detect and pickup marked dirt diagonally away from them
 - ants won't move to a square one off from them and always pick up diagonally
 - blueprint doesn't allow simple click, only drag
 - ants consume entire food on click and not just their configured amount
 - update Go To Clicked Location to always point at last location instead of first
 - two ants can eat the same food at the same time
 - selection marquee doesn't work 100% from every angle
 - getNeighborhoodLocation fails every once in a while
 - updateTask doesn't always work...


 - - - - - - DONE - - - - - -
 - clicking to select ants

 - remove concept of caste
 - fix rendering of entity radius vs size
 - implement entities with varying sizes
 - collides selector should detect collisions with arbitrary sized entities
 - implement interpreter for tasks/behaviors
 - add controls for ants
 - support holding various types of entities

 - object should be a typed payload
 - press enter to start game

 - put down in a neighbor position, not your own
 - implement mark mode and click-and-drag to mark dirt
 - create UI for adding new locations
 - settle on location vs entity structures

 - use entities for all entities, Arrays of ids for the rest, selectors to get entityByType
 - ants shouldn't collide with locations
 - track entityIDs instead of entities themselves

 - don't allow putting down held entity into dirt
 - console commands for quickly assigning tasks

 - conditional for neighboring blueprinted dirt
 - Automate digging out blueprints
    - task for moving randomly (in colony) until blueprint found
    - that then switches to a task that takes the dirt out of the colony
    - switch to task that finds drop-off locations and moves until free spot to place it
    - then switch back to finding colony entrance
    - ants move dirt out of their way if they are blocked

 - behaviors shouldn't have a "done" flag or by mutable at all
 - ants should track their task index, not the task itself
 - make random move not cross colony entrance boundary
 - make git repo
 - convert hunger to calories
 - implement food items that can be consumed
 - ants die when they reach 0 calories
 - color ants differently when they are close to starving
 - dead ants remain but are indicated differently somehow
 - ants can only consume a food once before mouse system fails

 - helper for abstracting away constructing/composing common conditions/locations
 - config for pickup-able entities
 - getEntitiesByType should optionally take in array of multiple types
 - make renderEntity recursive for rendering picked-up entities
 - handle food items in collisions and picking up
 - distinguish between ants picking up food and ants eating food via UI
 - preview for location creation while you drag
 - implement marquee selection
 - add sidebar card for selected ant statuses
 - allow assigning tasks to selected ants via UI
 - have ants un-stack in a sensible way
 - visually distinguish queen from workers
 - Add a X to the AntCard to deselect it
 - AntCard should call out when ants are hungry

 - UI for editing behaviors/tasks
    - remove function inside SWITCH_TASK behavior
    - implement Add Behavior button in TaskCard
 - Ant egg/larva/pupa life-cycles

 - test every interaction
 - make food spawn at random
 - visually distinguish starving/fed larva
 - prevent ants from moving off-screen
 - only lay eggs on top of dirt
 - UI for naming locations, name of location floating in space
 - making another location with same name replaces it

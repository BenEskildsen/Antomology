Antomology 2020

NOTE: you shouldn't need to compile when you first clone because I commit all
the compiled bin files too
compile with
 > ./compile.bash
files in js get babelified into the bin directory,
and then browser-side-required into bundle.js

deploy with
 > git add --all
 > git commit -m "some message"
 > git push -u origin master

run the app locally with:
 > npm start
then in the browser go to:
  localhost:8000

Game Instructions:
 - select ants with left-click and drag
 - send them somewhere with right-click
 - use the dropdowns in the sidebar to change what left- and right-click does
 - assign pre-made tasks to selected ants OR
 - use the task editor to edit or create new tasks ants can do
 - the larger ant is the queen who can lay eggs if she is directly above dirt
   (use Lay Egg task)
 - eggs become larva, then larva need to be fed food until they reach a calorie threshold
   to become pupa. Then pupa hatch into more ants
 - ants can die of starvation so they need to eat too
 - food spawns randomly every ~5 seconds
 - how many ants can you keep alive at the same time?
